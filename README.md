# Individual Project - Henry Countries

## Hello, world!

I created this web app as a project for the bootcamp I started a few months ago. I learned A LOT doing it (both about software development and about myself) which is why I enjoyed the process so much.
Feel free to wander around the repo, and contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ana-harrington/) if you have any questions!

**Note:** I have deployed it using Vercel, but I also included instructions in case you want to clone the project and run it locally on your computer :)

## 🌍 About this project:

The purpose of this app is to provide users with information about every country in the world (fetched from the external API [restcountries](https://restcountries.eu/)), as well as allow them to:

- Search for countries,
- filter and sort them using different criteria, and
- create touristic activities in each country.

These are the technologies and languages I used to make this app come to life:

### Frontend:

- React,
- Redux, and
- CSS Modules

### Backend:

- JavaScript,
- NodeJS, and
- Express

### DB and ORM:

- PostgreSQL, and
- Sequelize.

**IMPORTANT:** In order to run this project locally, you'll need the latest stable version of Node and NPM. Please make sure you do before installing the dependencies.

By the time I finished it (August, 2021), I was using these versions:

- **Node**: 12.18.3
- **NPM**: 6.14.16

To check your current version run these commands:

> node -v
>
> npm -v

## Getting started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone the repository on your computer
3. cd into the /api directory and run the following commands:

> npm install

This will start the server on your localhost:3001

4. cd back into the root directory.
5. cd into the /client directory and run the following commands:

> npm install
>
> npm start

This will run your app on your localhost:3000
